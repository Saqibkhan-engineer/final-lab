MVC Architecture:



The Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern is used to separate concerns within the system. Here's how each part works:

Model: Represents the data and business logic. In this case, SmartLight is the model that holds the state (e.g., status) of the light.
View: Represents the UI or the visual components of the system. Here, LightControlUI acts as the view, providing a user interface to control the light and display its status.
Controller: Manages communication between the view and model. User plays the role of a controller, sending commands to the SmartLight (model) via the Command interface. The LightControlUI can also be seen as the controller in terms of interacting with both the model and the user.






How the code works:


User sends a command (e.g., TurnOnCommand or TurnOffCommand) to control the light through the method controlLight(). This method is part of the User class, and it uses the Command pattern to send commands to the SmartLight object.

The Command object is passed to the SmartLight, and when executed, it calls methods like turnOn() or turnOff() on the SmartLight class, depending on the concrete command.

The LightControlUI class is responsible for the user interface. It updates the status 

of the light based on the userâ€™s interaction and provides methods like setupUI() to initialize the UI components and updateStatus() to display the current state of the light (on or off).






1. Information Expert:


The SmartLight class is the information expert for managing the state of the light (whether it's on or off). It is the appropriate place to encapsulate the logic for changing the light's state since it has the data (status).
2. Creator:


The User class can be considered the creator of the Command objects. The User sends commands (such as TurnOnCommand or TurnOffCommand) to control the SmartLight, effectively "creating" the commands to be executed.
3. Low Coupling:


The design adheres to low coupling by using the Command pattern. The User does not directly interact with the SmartLight; instead, it communicates through Command objects. This decouples the User from the details of how the light is controlled and allows for flexibility in extending the system.
4. Controller:



The User class acts as the controller, receiving input (commands) and directing it to the appropriate objects (e.g., the Command objects and the SmartLight). It manages the flow of the system without dealing directly with the light's state or UI elementsSmartLight contains the light's status and can be turned on or off through methods like turnOn() and turnOff().
